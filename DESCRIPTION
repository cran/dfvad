Description: Decomposing value added growth into explanatory factors.
    A cost constrained value added function is defined to specify the 
    production frontier. Industry estimates can also be aggregated using 
    a weighted average approach.
    Details about the methodology and data can be found in Diewert and Fox (2018)
